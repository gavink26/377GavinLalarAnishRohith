This project analyzes the career statistics of Lebron James, and also plots visible data for his career averages and FG% over time.

For activity 4, you need to download the JFreeChart library and add it to the "lib" folder. We used JFreeChart to generate images
that graphed the data.

Your files should look like this if you did it all correctly.
